## Description 

[Visit the Deployed Site]()

For this project, I create a employee tracker where a user can track and manage the employees in their organization.


## Usage 
This site is quite simple to use. Once you run it on the command line, you're presented with prompts. You then simply select which prompt applies to what you want to do at the time.


## Learning Points 
I got to learn more on working with MySQL and Node.js. I was able to improve these areas in my skillset.
